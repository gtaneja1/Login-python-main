# ✍️ Grammar Check  Tool

A powerful command-line grammar checker that supports both basic and advanced grammar correction. This project starts with a secure login and registration system and allows users to enter text manually or upload a file. Two editor modules power the grammar checking features: one using **TextBlob** for basic spell checking, and the other using **OpenAI** for full grammar analysis, spelling corrections, and synonym suggestions.
